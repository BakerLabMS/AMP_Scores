# AMP_Scores
The following code walks through an example of how to calculate AMP scores. Data is first simulated to mimic MSI data, with two classes generated from a normal distribution with differing means. The data are then split at the sample level, and feature selection is performed using Lasso, random forest, and support vector machine. Following selection, features are weighted using logistic regression, and AMP scores are then calculated and visualized using boxplots and heatmaps. This script should be runnable after downloading as long as appropriate libraries are installed and can be easily adjusted for use on real MSI data.
